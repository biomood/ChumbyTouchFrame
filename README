Chumby Library

Two C libraries, screen.h and touch.h for interacting with the frame buffer and touch screen of the chumby.
Very much a work in progress, setting up calibration for the touch screen.

1. ensure that you have the gcc compiler installed
2. upload the directory to the chumby
3. cd to the directory
4. enter 'make' in

To build on PC
